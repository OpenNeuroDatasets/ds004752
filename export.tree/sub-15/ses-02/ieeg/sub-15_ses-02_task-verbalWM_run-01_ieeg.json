    "TaskDescription": "In the task, sets of consonants are presented and have to be memorized. The set size (4, 6, or 8 letters) determines working memory workload. In each trial, presentation of a letter string (encoding period, 2 s) is followed by a delay (maintenance period, 3 s). After the delay, a probe letter is presented. Participants indicate whether the probe was in the letter string or not.",
